- i had oscillation issues with vehicle omtion because of a list of issues howefer adding angular drag to the rigid body somehow fixed it. the addition was done inscript.




## Problems yet to be solved

Navigation:
- the navigator regenerates the path after reaching final segment



## To do
Navigation:
- add a function to check if the vehicle is stuck and regenerate the path
- include the actual navigation algorithm
- get the start segment and end segment from the navigator
- ensure we have not passed the start segment when spawning the vehicle
