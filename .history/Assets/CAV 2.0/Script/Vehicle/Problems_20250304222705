    - This may affect the dynamic decision making
    - posibly wait  for the path to e generated before you move, ie the the status . go should be status. stop until a path is generatd


TODO

- add the spwn wait status go idea

- add the spawn direction proper to avoid roundabout
- add the car internal timer
- add the wait till no collision before spawn

- add the dynamic navigation






- work on the cost for dynamic
