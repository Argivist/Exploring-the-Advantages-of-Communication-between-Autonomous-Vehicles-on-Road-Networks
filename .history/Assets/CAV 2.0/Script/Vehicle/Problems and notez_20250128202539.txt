- i had oscillation issues with vehicle omtion because of a list of issues howefer adding angular drag to the rigid body somehow fixed it. the addition was done inscript.




## Problems yet to be solved

Navigation:
- the navigator regenerates the path after reaching final segment
    -possible source: when managing which pathfinder to use absed on the car type

CarController:
- heavy oscillation when the vehicle is taking a turn
    - possible solution: cause vehicle to slow down when taking a turn and speed up when going straight
        - may be able to include the lane speed controller for all vehicles



## To do
Navigation:
- add a function to check if the vehicle is stuck and regenerate the path
- include the actual navigation algorithm
- get the start segment and end segment from the navigator
- ensure we have not passed the start segment when spawning the vehicle
- path segment generation done with start and end segment.

Communication:
~- ensure the vehicle navigator tracks entry and exit into and out of segments

Vehicle:
- add a function to check if the vehicle is stuck and regenerate the path
~- ensure vehicle stops when it reaches the end of the segment
- the vehicle start and stop at segment should be controlled by the navigator under orders from the communication module
- distance controller should be able to control the speed of the vehicle and when t slows down and speeds up
