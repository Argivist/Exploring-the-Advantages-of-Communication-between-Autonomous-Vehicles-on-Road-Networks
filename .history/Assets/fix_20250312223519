Address
-------
- Cost function
           Track vehicle entry and exit
- Spawn direction bug--> has to do with when next doesn't have a next waypoint|ome vehicles go back to waypoint 0 when spawned at waypoint 1, look into the waypoint checker where we get path[1]
- spawn direction is still an issue
- sot function
	record data using the com agent
	calculate cost function in com central
- update segment density
- vehicles sometimes don't destroy check destroy function|some vehicles don't destroy::-->Possibly fixed
- intersection bug error










COST FUNCTION
-------------

-time spent on road
-road density
-road length
-speed



cost=congestion time cost-freeflow cost

congetion time cost=dist/avg speed(on road)
avg speed on road=dist/avg time

ctc=avg time

ffcost=dist/max speed(on road)[1/position change per frame]

cost=avgtime-(dist*pos change per frame(highest))

speed=dist_trav/swtime,calc rate based on pos change to sw time
